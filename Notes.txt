Section 1 : Getting Started

- Introduction
? Fundamental Concepts
? Creating concepts
? Browing project history
? Branching & merging
? Collaborating using Github
? Rewriting history

- What is git
? Popular version control system
? Version control system 
Records changes made to code over time in a database
called repository.
History : who has made what changes and when
? Track History, Work Together
? 2 types of VCS
Centralized :
All team members connect to center server to get latest copy
and share changes with others. E.g. : Subersion, Team Foundation Server
Problem is, single point of failure, i.e., central server
Distributed :
Every member have copy of the project and history, so snapshots are saved locally
Can synchronize work directly with others
E.g. : Git, Mercurial
? Git : Free, open source, super fast, scalable, cheap branching/merging
? More than 90% of project uses git.

- Using git
? The command line : fastest, easiest
? Code editors & IDEs
? VSCode : extension - GitLens
? Graphical User Interfaces
GitKraken, Sourcetree
GUI tools have limitations
GUI tools are not always available

- Installing git
? Check git version : git --version

- Configuring git
? Config - Name (user.name), Email (user.email),
Default Editor (core.editor "code --wait"),
Line Ending (core.autocrlf) :
crlf - carriage return line feed
Windows uses - cr+lf, Linux/macos - lf
In windows setting will be - true
In linux/macOs for removing cr on storing,
setting will be - input
? e.g. - git config --global user.name "Mosh Hamedani"
? Level : 
System - All users,
Global - All repo of the current user,  git config --global
Local - The current repo
? Configuration settings are store in text file (.gitconfig),
open it as :
git config --global -e

- Getting Help
? search online : git config
? on termial : get <option> --help, git <option> -h
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2 : Creating Snapshots

- Initialize a repository
? git init
? ls -a : listing all files including hidden
? .git folder has
foldes : branches, hooks, info, objects, refs
files : config, description, HEAD
? Terminal app : zsh with git plugin

- Git workflow
? Create/Modify files > Add to staging area > Create commit
? Staging area also called as Index
? Staging area used to review work
? Changes can be unstaged.
? Staging area is not empty after commiting changes.
It is similar to commited snapshot.
? Commit has
ID - generated by git
Message, Date/time, Author, Complete snapshot.
? Git compresses content and doesn't store duplicate content.

- Staging files
? Adding files to staging area
git add file1 file2 ... / git add *.txt
For all files : git add . 
? echo hello > file : writes to file
? echo hello >> file : appends to file
? Adding files to staging area copies files to it.

- Committing changes
? git commit -m "message"
? If commit message is long then use
git commit, then default editor will open to write message for commit.
Ideally : first line is short description (<80 chars), then after line break 
type long description. 
lines starting with # will be ignored.

- Committing best practices
? Commit shouldn't be too big or small. (update of a file, feature wise)
? Commit often.
? Each commit should represent logical separate chain set.
? Fixing bug and type should be in different commits
? Create meaningful commit messages
? Wording : Present or Past tense.

- Skipping the staging area
? Not needing review
? git commit -a -m "message" or 
git commit -am "message"
? -a is for all modified files.

- Removing files
? Delete file then > git add > commit it.
? Files in staging area : git ls-files
? git command for removing files
git rm <filenames or patterns>
Removes both from directory and staging area.

- Renaming or moving files
? Rename/remove > git add (for deletion and addition) > commit it
? After staging, git recognizes renaming of files.
? git command for renaming/moving files
git mv currentfilename targetfilename
Renaming/moving is applied to both working directory and staging area 

- Ignoring files
? Create .gitignore file in root of project
? Add files and directories to it as
logs/
main.log
*.log
? It only work when file are not included in repository.
? Untracking files
Remove file from staging area : git rm --cached -r filename
Then commit it
? github.com/github/gitignore, gitignore templates

- Short status
? git status -s
left column : staging area
right column : working directory
? - untracked, M - modified, A - added

- Viewing staged and unstaged changes
? git diff --staged
between staged area and last commit
? git diff
between working directory and staging area
? Output
1. diff --get a/file1.js b/file1.js 
diff utility was called with args. a is old (in commit) b in (staging area)
2. index badfb70...47c3216 100644 <- Meta data
3. --- a/file1.js
+++b/file1.js

It has line no (from to to)
it gives context to chunk.
git divides file in chunks and shows them with header, with
